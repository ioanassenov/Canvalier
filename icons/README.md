# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Setup

You can:
1. Create custom icons using any image editor
2. Use a free icon from sites like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) or [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
3. Or temporarily remove the `icons` section from `manifest.json` if you want to skip icons for now

## Recommended Design

- Use Canvas-related imagery (books, clipboard, calendar, etc.)
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use colors that match Canvas's branding (blues and whites)
- Make sure the icon works on both light and dark backgrounds
